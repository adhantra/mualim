### Tech

Mualim uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Android Studio](https://www.google.com/search?q=android+studio&oq=android+studio&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.1567j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) - Awesome Android text editor
* [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) - Unified visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Awesome web-based text editor
* [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/) - Bot framework by Google
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=id) - A cloud-hosted database
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - Web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax

And of course Mualim itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/adhantra/thesis)
